<p>This could be done with pipes as well to avoid intermediate files.</p>

<p>Note that –all looks at remotes, and for the most part this is what you want - your clone of
a repo rarely has tracking branches for all branches in the the remote(s), but you almost
certainly want information about that data.</p>

<p>By default, <code class="highlighter-rouge">git log</code> uses the medium pretty format, which looks like this</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">commit e22c092b573c93e8d9c358330ad65c82c14bff0a

    Mass query of Github

    Do queries <span class="k">for </span>repos, orgs, users <span class="k">for </span>GitHub. Also handle GitHub
    Enterprise <span class="o">(</span>the Ghosthub instance<span class="o">)</span>.

    Add --dir option to working.py to allow working dir to be <span class="nb">set
    </span>from the <span class="nb">command </span>line <span class="o">(</span>slight improvement to workflow<span class="o">)</span>.</code></pre></figure>

<p>You might find you want to go
beyond that, but <code class="highlighter-rouge">--pretty=format:&lt;fmt&gt;</code> looks daunting. Here is a format string that
reproduces the medium pretty format:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">git log --pretty<span class="o">=</span>format:<span class="s2">"%C(auto)commit %H%nAuthor: %an &lt;%ae&gt;%nDate: %ad%n%n%w(0,4,4)%s%n%n%b"</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">git log help</code> page has a section that covers all the format operators, although
some are hard to puzzle out just from the docs. In particular, indented formatting is
not explained well. The string <code class="highlighter-rouge">%w(0,4,4)</code> means to not wrap lines, indent the first line
by 4 spaces, and indent remaining lines by 4 spaces. This also stays in effect until
changed.</p>

<p>More importantly, in logs you want to process with code, you’ll probably not indent them, and
you won’t colorize them either.</p>

<p>If you use one-line formats, you’ll probably want to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">---pretty=tformat:&lt;fmt&gt;</code><code class="highlighter-rouge">instead.
The</code><code class="highlighter-rouge">format</code><code class="highlighter-rouge">option uses separator semantics, whereas the</code><code class="highlighter-rouge">tformat</code><code class="highlighter-rouge">option uses terminator semantics.
This is a lot of words to say that the file entry in</code><code class="highlighter-rouge">format</code>`` won’t have a newline appended.</p>

<h1 id="same-commit-hash-in-two-or-more-repos">Same commit hash in two or more repos</h1>

<p>If you have the same commit in two repos, then you have some kind of fork or clone relationship.
Since a commit hash depends on the parent commit hash(es), and because the likelihood of random
hashes colliding is close to zero, then the only way that the same commit can appear in two repos
is if one is a fork or clone of the other. It’s not possible to determine which is the clone of
the other, algorithmically, but this can usually be done by inspection.</p>

<p>This also doesn’t have to go back to the root commit(s): one party could have pruned old history.</p>

<p>There is one other way that’s technically not a fork, and that is to have pulled in commits from
another repo into your repo as a new independent tree. Git is a collection of commits, and you can
have more than one root commit. I think you could get this with a subtree merge, as well as by
just directly doing it.</p>

<p>But the starting principle is that each commit hash refers to unique work, so identical commit
hashes are referring to the same exact work.</p>
