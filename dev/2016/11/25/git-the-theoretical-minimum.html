  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I intend to write a book titled “Git: The Theoretical Minimum”, inspired by Leonard Susskind’s
two books <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Theoretical-Minimum-Start-Doing-Physics/dp/0465075681">The Theoretical Minimum: What You Need to Know to Start Doing Physics</a>
and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Mechanics-Theoretical-Leonard-Susskind/dp/0465062903">Quantum Mechanics: The Theoretical Minimum</a>
(also see his web site <a href="http://theoreticalminimum.com/">The Theoretical Minimum</a>). These
are awesome books and I recommend them to anyone, because physics is all around us and
having a working knowledge of it is a good thing.</p>

<p>My reasoning in a nutshell is this: Git is the first real version control system, or rather
it is probably the ancestor of the first real one. And while it is not as complicated to use
as detractors like to say, it’s also not been explained in a succinct fashion. There are now
many thousands of pages written, and yet a lot of Git is not explained except in answers
to StackOverflow questions or by looking at the source.</p>

<p>I think this means that there is a need for a short volume that explains everything you need
in order to do anything with Git, and I also think that this overlaps with “everything about
version control” to a staggering degree. I don’t mean to have the encyclopedic volume that
literally writes down everything, but rather the bare minimum you need in order to do anything
you need to on your own. For example, the Git help is pretty good, but it’s also only good if
you already understand things - it’s more a reminder reference than something you consult in
order to learn what to do.</p>

<p>For example, it is probably not important to describe the Git plumbing model, but it is
important to describe exactly how commits work, because that’s at the heart of many Git
operations. What I hope to do is to find the basic set of things you need to know about
any useful version control system, and describe them; the fact that it will be Git-centric
is because Git is the most popular example of a good version control system at the moment.</p>

<p>Separately, I want to finish the survey of all version control systems, so that we can put
most of them to bed as past history. “I have not come here to praise Perforce but to bury it”.</p>
