I'll write some stuff here soon, I swear. Here's the 10,000 foot view.

I've been writing software since the late 70's (1978, to be precise). I've been at Blizzard Entertainment for 15 or 20 years, depending on how you count time (the first 5 years, I had a small Macintosh porting company, but 90% of what we did was for Blizzard). I've also done medical software and other odds and ends that have nothing to do with the game industry.

I read a lot, I used to play and compose music and I'll get back to that at some point, and of course I play games.

I also write a lot of software.

I have a old blog at [http://blog.bfitz.us](http://blog.bfitz.us), and I'll transfer its contents here shortly.
