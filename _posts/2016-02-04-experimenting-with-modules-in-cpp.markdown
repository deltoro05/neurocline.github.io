There is a proposal to add modules to the C++ standard.

[A Module System for C++ (Revision 3)](http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2015/n4465.pdf)

This builds on a much earlier proposal in 2006 by Daveed Vandevoorde

[Modules in C++](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2006/n2073.pdf)

Microsoft has done an early implementation in Visual Studio 2015 Update 1 (because the authors of the
new module proposal package work at Microsoft)

[C++ Modules in VS 2015 Update 1](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2015/12/03/c-modules-in-vs-2015-update-1/)

I'm not terribly excited about some parts of their proposal and implementation. But I should play with it. So. I will play with it.
Update to come.
