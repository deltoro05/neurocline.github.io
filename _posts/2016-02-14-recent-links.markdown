[List of all leap seconds to date (early 2016)](https://www.ietf.org/timezones/data/leap-seconds.list). There have been 27 leap seconds (all positive, none negative) from Jan 1972 to July 2015. At first, we were doing a leap second a year, but in the past 15 years, we've only had 4 of them. The responsible group is considering halting the issuing of leap seconds.
