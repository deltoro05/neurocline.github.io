![My helpful screenshot](/assets/JekyllBlogging.jpg)

Several times I've started a blog and been unsatisfied with the results. Or rather, I want
something more than a blog, more than recording moments.

I want a place to record things I learn, for two reasons - for later reference by me, and
because sometimes what I learn is also useful to others. I've been using blogging software
because that's what was at hand -first Wordpress and then Jekyll. But Jekyll's not what I
want either. Perhaps I need to write something.

I like the idea of Jekyll letting me just write in text, with a little markup. I want
more control than Jekyll gives, because I want more control than what HTML5 gives. And
that's one challenge, because unless I go far off the beaten path, whatever I make needs
to be accessed through a web browser.

I want to gather and present large amounts of information. Half book, half magazine, half
blog, half notebook. Search is important. But so are graphics, and I mean diagrams, not
just photos for color or art purposes.

So

* bend [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) to the task, or [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), or Turbogears, etc
* microframework like Bottle or Flask
* write my own
* maybe something using WebGL instead of HTML?

I think something in C++ would be interesting. So few web frameworks in C++, I just see

* [CppCMS â€” The C++ Web Development Framework](http://cppcms.com/wikipp/en/page/main) and see [CppCMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CppCMS) page on Wikipedia.
* [POCO Project](http://pocoproject.org/) and see [POCO C++ Libraries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POCO_C%2B%2B_Libraries) page on Wikipedia.
* [TntNet](http://www.tntnet.org/) and see [Tntnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tntnet) page on Wikipedia.

I remember reading about something else recently, too.

The main issue, now that I'm looking at web frameworks, is that none of them is what I want.
I don't want to pump out huge amounts of content written by many people. I want something
better than a Wiki but a little more dynamic than a book.

And this is a huge distraction from what I really want to be doing. This has the echo of Knuth
spending ten years writing TeX because he wanted a better way to publish math-heavy books.
