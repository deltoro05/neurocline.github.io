[Babun](https://babun.github.io/). A Windows shell you will love - except it's mostly just a packaged Cygwin. But maybe that's enough?

ZIP file handling in C/C++

* [minizip](https://github.com/nmoinvaz/minizip). Fairly comprehensive, built on top of zlib. I think this is based on Giles Volant code for Winimage, see [Minizip: Zip and UnZip additional library](http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/minizip.html)
* [Zipper](https://github.com/sebastiandev/zipper) is a C++ wrapper on top of minizip.
* [libzip](http://www.nih.at/libzip/index.html) is another library for reading/writing ZIP archives, and has seen use in some big programs. Unfortunately, it has an attribution license (binaries must reproduce the libzip copright notice).
* [Zipping/Unzipping files in C++](http://vilipetek.com/2013/11/22/zippingunzipping-files-in-c/) is a more barebones approach, again built on top of zlib. Except that there's almost no code here, so does zlib itself have zipfile support?
* [Zip Utils - clean, elegant, simple, C++/Win32](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/7530/Zip-Utils-clean-elegant-simple-C-Win)

[Dead2/zlib-ng](https://github.com/Dead2/zlib-ng). Zlib fork because the author wanted changes that were not being accepted upstream.
