Diomidis Spinellis has put together a Git repo with 44 years of Unix
source code commits, starting with 1972 source from Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie.

[A Repository with 44 Years of Unix Evolution](http://www.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/pubs/conf/2015-MSR-Unix-History/html/Spi15c.html)

The repo can be found here

The code that Spinellis used to create the repo can be found here

[dspinellis/unix-history-make](https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-make)

This is important stuff. More long-running projects should be put together like
this.
