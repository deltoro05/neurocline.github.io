The C++ standard has been a thing since 1998. In recent years, it's been a concerted and ongoing effort, which
is great to see, since C++ is still the closest thing we have to the one true language.

[JTC1/SC22/WG21 - The C++ Standards Committee - ISOCPP](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/) is the
home of the C++ standards committee itself.

The [https://isocpp.org](https://isocpp.org) web site is relatively new, but it is becoming the one-stop place
for information about the C++ standard.

[The Committee: WG21](https://isocpp.org/std/the-committee) is the group that oversees the evolution of the standard,
both language and libraries. They meet face-to-face two to three times a year, see [Meetings and Participation](https://isocpp.org/std/meetings-and-participation). Having attended one of their quarterly week-long meetings (Jacksonville, FL), I have even more respect for the [people involved](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/wg21).

The [June 2016 WG21 Meeting](https://isocpp.org/files/papers/N4570.pdf) will be in Oulu, Finland from 20-June-2016
through 25-June-2016. It should be interesting, as we shephard our prototype paper from scary idea to something
that meets general approval.

WG21 allows walk-in observers, but to be a voting member, you need to be a member of a national standards body that
ISO recognizes. For the US, this is ANSI. It's slightly unclear to me how much this costs. I assume this is ANSI
in the US, but the [ANSI Company Membership Application 2016](http://publicaa.ansi.org/sites/apdl/Documents/Membership/Company_Application.pdf) quote a basic membership cost of $995 whereas the
[Meetings and Participation](https://isocpp.org/std/meetings-and-participation) quotes $1995. For a large company,
it's upwards of $30K/year, so you need to be serious about it.

[ISO/IEC JTC1 Procedures](https://isocpp.org/std/iso-iec-jtc1-procedures) details how the ISO C++ committee operates, relative to ISO and IEC. USNC/IEC is the specific section of ANSI that this falls under, at least for the US.

[PL22.16 - Programming Language C++](https://standards.incits.org/a/public/group/pl22.16) is the US group that
corresponsds to SC22/WG21.
