The influence of money in politics goes back thousands of years, and very likely longer. We
try to make institutions that can run properly, making good decisions. The American form
of government has done pretty well over the years, despite the influence of money ("buying votes").

Can we do better? Quadratic Voting is an attempt to do so. Basically, the cost of votes
goes up quadratically with the number of votes you cast. You can cast as many votes as
you want, but it will cost you.

One of the coolest variants I heard, Quadratic Vote Buying, is quite simple: you can spend as
much money on votes as you want. All the voting money is returned equally to the whole voting
public (whether they voted or not). So, as an example, assume there are 10 voters, and I'm one
of them. Everyone except me casts 1 vote, and I cast 10 votes. My 10 votes cost me $100, and all
others pay $1 each for their 1 vote. At the end, each of us gets $10.90 returned. So I might
get my way, but you get my money to cushion the blow. And with a lot of voters, it's still really
hard to get your way if it differs from the majority. In fact, that's the point; in current systems
you can buy elections, in Quadratic Voting, it's harder, but it's allowed.

I want to do my own explorations into this idea, but in the mean time, here are some
things you can read. Or the names you can Google include:

* Glen Weyl
* Steven P. Lalley
* Rory Sutherland

The first reference I saw to this was on Marginal Revolution, but it's been around for
a while, I just missed hearing about it.
