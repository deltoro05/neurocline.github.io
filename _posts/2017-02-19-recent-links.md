It looks like Gnuplot is still in CVS. This is the first live project I've come across
that is still in CVS.

Some bits about Python object-oriented code, because I'm a beginner.

Dylan added things to the computing landscape. One of them was the C3 superclass linearization
algorithm, and is also called Method Resolution Order (MRO). Python started using it in 2.3.
