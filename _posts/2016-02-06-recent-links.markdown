XCode is very spammy, and there are lots of files you don't want in source control

* [Git ignore file for Xcode projects](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/49478/git-ignore-file-for-xcode-projects)

Stack Exchange is going through a long and moderately painful process to clarify attribution. This
seems to be driven by a combination of two things; the belief that everything is copyrighted, and
our (overly?) litigious society. Editorial note: this should not be necessary, even large code
snippets are not so masterful that they need or deserve copyright protection.

Public Domain Curses is a project to make ncurses available for "not-Unix"; currently it covers
DOS, OS/2, Win32, X11 and SDL. There is an interesting fork that directly uses Win32 APIs that
the developer is trying to get merged into the main version.
