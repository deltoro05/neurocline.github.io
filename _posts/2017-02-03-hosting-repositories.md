## Public access

So, who hosts repositories for public access?

* Github: https://github.com
* Bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org
* CodePlex: http://www.codeplex.com/
* SourceForge: https://sourceforge.net/
* LaunchPad: https://launchpad.net/
* Savannah: http://savannah.gnu.org/
* Gna: http://gna.org/
* Gitlab: http://gitlab.com
* Apache Software Foundation: https://www.apache.org/dev/version-control.html
* repo.or.cz: http://repo.or.cz/

### CodePlex

Slow to browse, and the UI is a little lame by modern standards. I think it's mostly
dead, because the last blog post on the site is from October 13 2013. I didn't find
any "we are going away" post but they must be going away. And I see people still using it,
so hmm.

CodePlex has Subversion repositories on it, e.g. https://vstortoise.svn.codeplex.com/svn.
But I think you have to guess where they are, you can't just easily browse just
Subversion repositories. Don't think there's an API either.

### Sourceforge

Still around, and getting disreputable. Sourceforge I think is only Subversion,
e.g. svn checkout https://svn.code.sf.net/p/doublecmd/code/trunk doublecmd-code

## From the past

These are the big players of the past that shut down (largely because Github won). Some
still run in read-only mode:

* Google Code: https://code.google.com (archived at https://code.google.com/archive/)
* Gitorious: https://gitorious.org/ (migrating to Gitlab)

## Hosted providers

There are also hosted providers that will host your repositories, but I don't think there
is public access

* Assembla: https://assembla.com
* ProjectLocker: https://www.projectlocker.com/
* XP-Dev.com: https://xp-dev.com/
* SVNRepository.com: http://svnrepository.com/
* SlikSVN: https://sliksvn.com
* CloudForge: http://www.cloudforge.com/
* Codebase: https://www.codebasehq.com/
* repositoryhosting.com: http://repositoryhosting.com/
* Unfuddle: https://unfuddle.com/
* Beanstalk: http://beanstalkapp.com/
* Deveo: https://deveo.com/
* FogBugz Dev hub: https://www.fogcreek.com/fogbugz/devhub
* Planio: https://plan.io/subversion-hosting-and-git-hosting/
* RhodeCode: https://rhodecode.com/
