Here are some packages I want to see.

* gmp (assorted links [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1twtvm/the_problem_with_integer/) and [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6990233) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Multiple_Precision_Arithmetic_Library) and [here](https://gmplib.org/) and [here](https://github.com/gx/gmp) and [here](https://github.com/ncw/gmp)). Of course, GMP is LGPL which really limits its ability to be used.
* libtommath, which is not GPL.
* every crypto algorithm
* web frameworks
* graphics libraries

Also, a decent fraction of the Standard C++ library might be better off as packages, at least in the proposed
drastically expanded version that includes game and UI libraries.
