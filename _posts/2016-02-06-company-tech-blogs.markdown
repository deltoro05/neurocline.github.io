A number of companies have tech blogs that are more than just self-aggrandizement or PR.

# Google

Google is the champion. I have no idea how many tech blogs they have. Here are the ones I know about. I have no doubt that there are others.

* [Official Google Blog](https://googleblog.blogspot.com/)
* [Google Public Policy Blog](http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/)
* [Google Student Blog](http://googleforstudents.blogspot.com/)
* [Official Android Blog](http://officialandroid.blogspot.com/)

Google also does research and publishes research articles

# Microsoft

I'm sure this is only scratching the surface. That said, Microsoft is still only a sometime
tech blogger, most of their communication is in tech docs, magazines and books, or in PR pieces.

# Netflix

Netflix is moderately unique when it comes to tech blogging, its blogs exist to describe its
internal technology; it develops all its tech to run its infrastructure, and releases large portions as open source.

As part of their semi-open stance, they have a unified open source presence/portal on Github.

The community put this summary description of their software stack together

# Apple

I don't think Apple has any tech blogs.

in sources like developerWorks.
