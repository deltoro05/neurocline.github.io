I'm playing with web fonts finally, starting with Google Fonts. At the moment,
the blog is set to use Old Standard TT, which has a certain charm for the body
text, but isn't that great for titles.

Other fonts I like from the Google Fonts set include Merriweather and Vollkorn,
although I'll probably go boring and use Open Sans. Another choice is to use
PT Serif and PT Sans, as they were designed to go together. But then I'll need
to figure out the CSS so I can have header fonts with a distinct type.
