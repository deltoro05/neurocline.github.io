After all of this, write up the exact process as a blog post. Because
it's not obvious to neophytes.

Downloaded rubyinstaller-2.1.6 from http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/, because
the notes on that page said "if you dont know what you're doing, pick 2.1.X".

And need to install DevKit from http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads and follow
instructions at http://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit.
This is a MinGW environment tailored for Ruby, evidently.

Note that I could do everything locally, and just push the generated site.
Or I can let GitHub do the Jekyll generation, but GitHub won't use Jekyll
third-party plugins.

Try 1 - run Jekyll locally, push changes to Github as a static site. Follow
the directions here: http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/

Try 2 - use the GitHub-recommended approach at 
https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/.
So install Bundler, Jekyll.
