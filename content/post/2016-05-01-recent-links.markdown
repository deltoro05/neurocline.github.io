[How to write good README and why should you care](http://thejunkland.com/blog/how-to-write-good-readme.html). There is a Git repo with a README template at [jehna/readme-best-practices](https://github.com/jehna/readme-best-practices).

[An API Of Ice And Fire](https://anapioficeandfire.com/Documentation). I'm not sure if this is serious or not, maybe this is just a great example project on "how to document a REST API".

[Type Wars](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2016/05/01/TypeWars.html). A moderately partisan take on type safety.

[Designing C APIs in 2016](https://anteru.net/2016/05/01/3249/)

[CoreOS and Prometheus: Building monitoring for the next generation of cluster infrastructure](https://coreos.com/blog/coreos-and-prometheus-improve-cluster-monitoring.html)

[Programming Language Theory](http://steshaw.org/plt/).

[The Ten Commandments of Egoless Programming](http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ten-commandments-of-egoless-programming/)

[Go best practices, six years in](https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/). Weak. Or, rather, lightweight and surface.

[Inline assembly](https://github.com/0xAX/linux-insides/blob/master/Theory/asm.md). GCC and Intel specific.

[C++ Has Become More Pythonic](http://preshing.com/20141202/cpp-has-become-more-pythonic/). Kind of. See comments.

[{fmt}](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt). Nice formatting library, vast improvement to streams but can interoperate. This is almost as fast as printf, but there's a big hit in compile time.

[Moving Past the Scaling Myth](https://michaelfeathers.silvrback.com/the-myth-of-scaling)
