So, this is interesting

[Notion](https://www.notion.so/)

Unfortunately, it's yet another appealing walled garden. I can create a lot of content
on their site - well, my private section on their site.

I don't know if I want to dump a lot of data into something that will probably go away.
But it is very slick.

Also, the name Notion is very heavily used.
