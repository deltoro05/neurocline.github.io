It's interesting working in a field for a long time, especially when you have a lot of long-term
projects running.

One thing I'm re-learning lately is the importance of deleting stuff, which is hard for me because
I need to balance it against the value of having history.

With no history, I find that I re-do things that I've done in the past. Memory is finite, distressingly
so. I'm left with the knowledge of how to do something but not the recollection that I already did it.
So that makes me really fast when doing it again, but not as fast as if I just found the previous
project and started from there.

But with lots of history, there's a drag imposed on just getting started. There are so many options
visible, so much from the past that I don't want to break. It's weird. Maybe it's just me, but I have
found that metaphorical desk cleaning is important from time to time.
