This is not an inclusive list by any means. I have favorites that I forget and then
rediscover (and wonder how I forgot them), and so I expect I'll update this list over
time. It's mostly for me to remember and to discover.

Some of my all-time favorites

* Stockhausen
* Walter/Wendy Carlos
* Synergy
* Tangering Dream
* Vangelis
* Jean-Michel Jarre
* Tomita
* Brian Eno

Some newer favorites

* VNV Nation

And even newer (just started listening to)

* Symbion Project
* Kodomo

Others I want to follow up on

* Freezepop
* Splashdown
* Yellow Magic Orchestra
* Gary Numan

In the 1980s and 1990s, I listened to the radio show [Hearts of Space](https://www.hos.com/)
a lot; as the name indicates, it focuses on slower electronic music: ambient and new-age. It
can still be found on a lot of radio channels across the US.
