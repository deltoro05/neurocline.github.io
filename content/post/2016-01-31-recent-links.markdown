Lots of reading this weekend. This should keep you busy for a month of nights. At least.

Good series of articles on "what can we learn from Linux design". The comments on some of the articles are better even than the articles.

* [Ghosts of Unix Past: a historical search for design patterns](https://lwn.net/Articles/411845/)
* [Ghosts of Unix past, part 2: Conflated designs](https://lwn.net/Articles/412131/)
* [Ghosts of Unix past, part 3: Unfixable designs](https://lwn.net/Articles/414618/)
* [Ghosts of Unix past, part 4: High-maintenance designs](https://lwn.net/Articles/416494/)

Older series from the same author:

* [Linux kernel design patterns - part 1](https://lwn.net/Articles/336224/)
* [Linux kernel design patterns - part 2](https://lwn.net/Articles/336255/)
* [Linux kernel design patterns - part 3](https://lwn.net/Articles/336262/)

[No-Vacation Nation Revisited](http://cepr.net/documents/publications/no-vacation-update-2013-05.pdf). It's a little biased in terms of intent (there's a thesis), but it collects a lot of data on vacation and leave across the richer part of the world.

[The automation myth](http://www.vox.com/2015/7/27/9038829/automation-myth). The tag line is "Robots aren't taking your jobsâ€” and that's the problem".

[Why a bunch of Silicon Valley investors are suddenly interested in universal basic income](http://www.vox.com/2016/1/28/10860830/y-combinator-basic-income)

[http://dubeyko.com/development/FileSystems/NTFS/ntfsdoc.pdf](http://dubeyko.com/development/FileSystems/NTFS/ntfsdoc.pdf). From the authors of the Linux NTFS filesystem, not Microsoft. Alas. Maybe the new Microsoft will see benefit to releasing documentation that's accurate.

[NTFS Forensics: A Programmers View of Raw Filesystem Data Extraction](http://grayscale-research.org/new/pdfs/NTFS%20forensics.pdf). NTFS on-disk layouts.

[extra.fld](http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/zip/zip-6/unzip/unzip/proginfo/extra.fld). All the ZIP file extension fields known (to the Info-ZIP project, anyway).

[Building and Installing Software Packages for Linux](http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-Building-HOWTO.html). Getting a bit old (this is from 1999), but still mostly relevant.

[Linux From Scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/). Build a Linux distribution from scratch. Requires access to an existing Linux system. Good source of low-level details on Linux.

[Visualizing Concurrency in Go](https://divan.github.io/posts/go_concurrency_visualize/). This is awesome.

[Bot Libre!](http://www.botlibre.org/)

[Signals](https://github.com/pbhogan/Signals). Billed as "A lightweight "signals and slots" implementation using fast delegates.". From 2004, and slightly updated in 2009.

[Do online social media cut through the constraints that limit the size of offline social networks?](http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/3/1/150292)

[ZL](http://zl-lang.org/). Interesting. Basically C++ with Scheme-style hygienic macros.

[Other single-file public-domain/open source libraries with minimal dependencies](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/docs/other_libs.md)

[Curious Namespace Trick](https://github.com/dchichkov/curious-namespace-trick/wiki/Curious-Namespace-Trick)

[The limitations of sampling profilers today, with glimpses of tracing tools from the future](http://danluu.com/perf-tracing/)

[The Unintentional side-effects of a bad concurrency model](http://joearms.github.io/2016/01/26/The-Unintentional-Side-Effects-of-a-Bad-Concurrency-Model.html)

[A Badass Way to Connect Programs Together](http://joearms.github.io/2016/01/28/A-Badass-Way-To-Connect-Programs-Together.html)

[Seesaw v2](https://github.com/google/seesaw). Load balancer written in Go.

[Introduction to the Autotools (autoconf, automake, and libtool)](http://www.dwheeler.com/autotools/). I'm not suggesting Autotools is good, it's the opposite. It's time to study everything so we can learn and grow.

[Comparison of C/POSIX standard library implementations for Linux](http://www.etalabs.net/compare_libcs.html)
