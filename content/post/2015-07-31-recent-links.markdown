At some point, I'll get back to actually posting substantive things.

[bokken](http://bokken.re/index.html): Open Source Reverse Code Engineering. Looks pretty
cool.

[Tony Chi talk at Mind the Product 2015](http://www.mindtheproduct.com/2015/07/video-tom-chi-on-rapid-prototyping-product-management/). This is awesome, watch it. Rapid prototyping, real-world
feedback over conjecture, keep loop length really short, etc.

[The Advanced Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/adv-book/). A sequel
of sorts to [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

[Supply Chain Evolution - Lessons from Ford and Toyota](http://www.rklesolutions.com/blog/supply-chain-evolution/)

[The Software Paradox: The Rise and Fall of the Commercial Software Market](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/files/software-paradox.pdf). Interesting
and somewhat flawed exploration of software markets.

[ConsoleZ](https://github.com/cbucher/console). Updated version of Console2 that is being
actively developed (better console on Windows).

[How to Type Korean on a Computer (in Windows 8, 7 or Vista)](http://www.koreanfluent.com/cross_cultural/korean_keyboard/korean_keyboard.htm).
It's hard to test that your software handles locales properly unless you can generate
a few test cases.

[Korean language and computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language_and_computers)

[Additional C/C++ Tooling](http://nickdesaulniers.github.io/blog/2015/07/23/additional-c-slash-c-plus-plus-tooling/)

[UTF-8 Everywhere](http://utf8everywhere.org/)
