[MARISA Trie](MARISA: Matching Algorithm with Recursively Implemented StorAge) and [C++ implementation](https://code.google.com/p/marisa-trie/). I'll have to write a version in Go to make sure I understand it. However, as a practical matter, I'm not sure this is really a viable data structure, because it's pretty slow and not that much more compression than zlib would produce. But I'll test that with my data sets.

[Type safe OpenGL - Converting strings into types in D](https://maikklein.github.io/2015/11/14/Converting-strings-to-types/). This makes me want to start programming in D.

[Anti-Education by Friedrich Nietzsche review â€“ why mainstream culture, not the universities, is doing our best thinking](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/08/anti-education-on-the-future-of-our-educational-institutions-friedrich-nietzsche-review). I've always liked Nietzsche, so I need to read this lecture series, because it's important to have an honest view of someone you respect. Maybe Nietzsche did have a strong basis but went in the wrong direction in the end.

[Probability, Paradox, and the Reasonable Person Principle](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/norvig.com/ipython/Probability.ipynb). Probability theory in Python by Peter Norvig. And this reminds me to look into Jupyter Notebooks. I like the expressiveness.

[go-observable](https://github.com/GianlucaGuarini/go-observable)

[Parsing 10TB of Metadata, 26M Domain Names and 1.4M SSL Certs for $10 on AWS](http://blog.waleson.com/2016/01/parsing-10tb-of-metadata-26m-domains.html)

[The Unreasonable Reputation of Neural Networks](http://thinkingmachines.mit.edu/blog/unreasonable-reputation-neural-networks)

[Andrei Alexandrescu Writing Fast Code I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph7FP0LnmcA)

[Introduction to Machine Learning](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O6ozzZHHxGzU-McpvEG09hl7K6oQDd2Taw0FOlnxJc8/preview?slide=id.p)

[Ultimate++ is a C++ cross-platform rapid application development framework](http://www.ultimatepp.org/index.html). I like the enthusiasm.

[A History of the World in 100 Objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_History_of_the_World_in_100_Objects)

[Rocket reusability launches new economy](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-commentary/rocket-reusability-launches-new-economy/article28226300/). Certainly the most significant event in the 21st century, and perhaps even the most significant one since the steam engine. General computing is up there, and if we ever actually do AI that would be on par or more significant.

[ArcadeRS 1.0: The project](http://jadpole.github.io/arcaders/arcaders-1-0/). A game written in Rust.

[The "Talent War" revisited](http://www.mindtangle.net/2011/07/22/the-talent-war-revisted/). From 2011. Using visualization to make sense of numbers.

[Printing floating-point numbers](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~lerner/papers/fp-printing-popl16.pdf). Spectacular! And see [GitHub repo](https://github.com/marcandrysco/Errol). Also, the main author on the paper has [other stuff](https://github.com/marcandrysco). Also see [his advisor](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~lerner/).

[Git Draw](https://github.com/ben174/git-draw). Umm.

[Four Things Working at Facebook Has Taught Me About Design Critique](https://medium.com/facebook-design/critique-is-an-important-part-of-any-design-process-whether-you-work-as-part-of-a-team-or-solo-ef3dcb299ce3#.ir759nlye)

[What Is Machine Intelligence Vs. Machine Learning Vs. Deep Learning Vs. Artificial Intelligence (AI)?](http://numenta.com/blog/machine-intelligence-machine-learning-deep-learning-artificial-intelligence.html). I feel like this is begging the question, even a little bit, since it starts out saying "In our view, there are three major approaches to building smart machines". At least they qualified this statement.
