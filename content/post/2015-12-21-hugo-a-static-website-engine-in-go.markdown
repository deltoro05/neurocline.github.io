Jekyll is beginning to annoy me, so I've been looking for alternatives other than "write my own"
(which is, admittedly, still appealing). There's one written in Go

[Hugo: A Fast & Modern Static Website Engine](https://gohugo.io/)

It looks like it would be trivial for me to switch or to try it out, so I'm going to do so.
