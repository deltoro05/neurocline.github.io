[How can I get a file's ctime,atime,mtime and change them using Golang?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20875336/how-can-i-get-a-files-ctime-atime-mtime-and-change-them-using-golang). Go is actually fetching some of these under the hood, and you can snarf them with a little platform-dependent code. For others, you need to make OS calls.
