Rcpp looks very interesting, letting you use R from inside a C++ program.

- [RInside](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rinside.html). The RInside package provides C++ classes that make it easier to embed [R](https://www.r-project.org/) in C++ codee -- on either Linux, OS X or Windows. This is part of the Rcpp project.
- [Rcpp](http://www.rcpp.org/). Rcpp provides a powerful API on top of R, permitting direct interchange of rich R objects (including S3, S4 or Reference Class objects) between R and C++
- [Seamless R and C++ Integration with Rcpp](http://www.rcpp.org/book/). The book. [Amazon link](http://www.amazon.com/Seamless-Integration-Rcpp-Dirk-Eddelbuettel/dp/1461468671). Also see [Intro paper](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp/Rcpp-introduction.pdf).
- [RcppCore/Rcpp](https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp). Github repo.
- [Gallery](http://gallery.rcpp.org/).
- [The R project](https://www.r-project.org/). Of course, it still leads back to here.

[GNP.h](https://github.com/Voultapher/Vool/blob/master/GNP.h). A simple wrapper to drive Gnuplot with popen.

[Gnuplot-iostream interface](http://www.stahlke.org/dan/gnuplot-iostream/). Drive gnuplot with an iostream pipe.

[ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/). A data anlysis framework largely written in C++. Used by CERN.

[Silicon 0.1](http://siliconframework.org/blog/silicon-0-1.html). Write HTTP APIs in C++.

[GNU Libmicrohttpd](http://www.gnu.org/software/libmicrohttpd/). GNU libmicrohttpd is a small C library that is supposed to make it easy to run an HTTP server as part of another application (their words, not mine).

[socat - Multipurpose relay](http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/). socat is a relay for bidirectional data transfer between two independent data channels.

[GnuTLS](http://www.gnutls.org/).

[LWAN](https://lwan.ws/). Lightweight asynchronous multithreaded event-based web server. Written in C.

[Sub-processing with modern C++](http://templated-thoughts.blogspot.in/2016/03/sub-processing-with-modern-c.html)

[Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html). This has been evolving over the years, and is becoming something I can agree with.

[Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/). Templating library for Python. Use it as a model for a C++ template library?

[cppit/jucipp](https://github.com/cppit/jucipp). juCi++: a lightweight, cross-platform C++-IDE supporting C++11, C++14, and experimental C++17 features. Lots of dependencies.

[cppformat](http://cppformat.github.io/latest/index.html). Small, safe and fast formatting library for C++. [Github repo](https://github.com/cppformat/cppformat).

[P0067R1: Elementary string conversions, revision 1](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0067r1.html). No implementation yet?

[A printf-like Interface for the Streams Library](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3506.html)

[RECURSIVELY WALKING A DIRECTORY WITH C++XY (FILESYSTEM + YIELD) [SIMILAR TO OS.WALK IN PYTHON]](https://dany74q.wordpress.com/2016/03/11/recursively-walking-a-directory-with-cxy-filesystem-yield-similar-to-os-walk-in-python/)

[Guidelines Support Library Review: span&lt;T>](http://codexpert.ro/blog/2016/03/07/guidelines-support-library-review-spant/).

[Error Context - a stack trace for data](http://www.ilikebigbits.com/blog/2016/2/28/error-context-better-logging-with).

[C++14 standard](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3797.pdf). Approximately; from late 2013.

[C11 standard](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1570.pdf). Late committee draft.

[Phases of translation](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/translation_phases). Slightly more readable than the standard. The preprocessor should be identical between C and C++.
