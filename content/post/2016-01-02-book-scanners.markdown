I think making and using a book scanner is in my future. I'm already at the point where I
throw away books because I can't store them for the far future where someone will care
(e.g. early computer books). And I don't want to re-buy thousands of books to have them
in electronic format, nor do I trust ANY of the current e-book vendors for longevity (which needs
to be measured in decades to centuries).

So, something like this

[DIY Book Scanner](http://www.diybookscanner.org/)

which has a huge community around it. There's even a semi-commercial builder, [Tenrec Builders](http://tenrec.builders/).

[How we built a DIY book scanner with speeds of 150 pages per minute](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/02/diy-book-scanning-is-easier-than-you-think/), article from 2013 on experience with the Reetz scanner kit.

[Atiz](http://www.atiz.com/) is a commercial company selling book scanners. No idea on price, will find out soon.

[Noisebridge](https://www.noisebridge.net/) is a hackerspace in San Francisco (16th & Mission); one of their groups is [Digital Archivists](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Digital_Archivists). Will be checking this out next Wednesday night.
