[CSS Grid Layout Module Level 1](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/). The good news is that Firefox, Chrome and Safari have all shipped their implementation of CSS Grid Layout. Bad news for IE: 10 and 11 support the original spec, and will not be updated, whereas Edge will be updated "soon".

I keep approaching web programming as engineering, and thus look down on it, because it's pretty lightweight, but it's really all about design, and the fact that engineering is required is just because we're not good enough at making tools yet. A long time ago, artists had to be technicians, because they had to make their own pigments, brushes, and so on, which was time away from making art. Some artists could do both and were on their own little plateau separate from the rest, but fortunately it's no longer required - in art. Web design is small-d design to this day because it requires just enough technical skill employed along with the art.

[Batteries included - the biggest impact on programming language popularity](https://szabgab.com/batteries-included.html). I've been slowly coming to this realization. It took a while, because I started when there was no code or libraries to re-use (none at all), and even after many years, we all just expected to write everything ourselves. The game industry still has this as a lingering behavior, although it is slowly dying out.
