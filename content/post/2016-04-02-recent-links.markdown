Unbreakable cryptography is both easy and hard. Unbreakable - given a long stream of random bits,
XOR it with your data. The result is unbreakable - if you have random bits, and both sides need
the same random bits. But if you want to communicate with a known person, and you expect that both
sides can keep their bitpad secret, then your communication will look like noise, and be unbreakable.
This is why authorities trying to backdoor crypto algorithms have different motives than the stated - they
don't want to catch terrorists this way, they want to read all communications, for no other reason than
to prop up the current regime, whatever that is.
