There is a saying: "history is told by the winners". It seems intuitively true, and that
is usually a warning sign that we're not thinking things through.

Recently a new thesis has been advanced: history is told by the losers. For an example of
the argument:

[History is Written by the Losers](http://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2016/11/history-is-written-by-losers.html)

This makes a compelling case - when you have an erudite person who is the winner, they
don't have time to write anything, but when that person is shoved aside, that person
may just write a history that's more palatable to them. The two cases cited cover the
origins of history-from-historians.

Here's how I look at it. There are two ways that history is written. The first is that history
is written by consensus; over time, we mostly converge to the same view. This maps to the "history
is written by the winners" side of things, because of course the winners have an outsized
influence on what is said.

But the other way that history is written is the auteur approach - a single person or small
group that selects what it thinks should be recorded. In the case of Siam Qian or Herodotus
or Thucydides, the stories are powerful enough to survive when the consensus history did not.
And over the very long stretch of time, when we have wars or other catastrophes that upset
and destroy specific civilizations, the consensus form of history doesn't survive.

It's an interesting thought. I'm still not sure that history is only or even largely written
by losers, but maybe with enough research we'll determine this is true.

Or maybe this view will be the one that survives because some loser will write it down and
promote it.
