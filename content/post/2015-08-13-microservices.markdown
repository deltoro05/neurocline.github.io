[Netflix/ribbon](https://github.com/Netflix/ribbon). Ribbon is a client side IPC library that provides load balancing, fault tolerance, multiple protocols in a async and reactive model, and caching and balancing.

[Netflix/Hystrix](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix). Hystrix is a latency and fault tolerance library designed to isolate points of access to remote systems, services and 3rd party libraries, stop cascading failure and enable resilience in complex distributed systems where failure is inevitable.
