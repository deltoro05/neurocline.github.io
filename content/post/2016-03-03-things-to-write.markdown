Write a C++ source highighter that uses Clang to identify the various
syntactic and semantic elements.

Write a web template/blog engine in C++.

Turn Clang into a two-pass compiler so that forward declarations aren't
needed any more. Do templates make this impossible? Find out.

Find a way to get rid of most/all of the undefined and unspecified
behavior in the C++ standard.

Find all the usable C and C++ source in the world, catalog it, and make it
available for use.

Solve text encoding.
