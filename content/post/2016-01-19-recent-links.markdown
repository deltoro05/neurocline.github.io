[https://adambard.com/blog/PHP-ruby-python-clojure-webapps-by-example/](https://adambard.com/blog/PHP-ruby-python-clojure-webapps-by-example/). We need more of this, a bake-off between a bunch of languages using a small but actually-does-something program. This problem is a web app, so any language without a web framework available is at a big disadvantage, of course. But what I think that says in this day and age is that any wants-to-be-serious programming language needs a web framework for it. Heck, even C and C++ have web frameworks now.

[https://git.github.io/rev_news/2016/01/13/edition-11/](https://git.github.io/rev_news/2016/01/13/edition-11/). I missed this somehow, but GitHub has started their own Git development newsletter. It's definitely more readable than the Git mailing list, not yet sure how accurate it is.

[TAPIR -- the Transaction Application Protocol for Inconsistent Replication](https://github.com/UWSysLab/tapir). I need to read up on this, sounds useful and dubious at the same time. I skimmed the paper, but I need to spend a few days reading through it carefully and then experimenting.

[Concurrent Programming Library (Coroutine) for C](https://github.com/sharow/libconcurrent). Tiny, but only has GCC-based runtime support, and with 15 seconds of reading I can't tell if this means Linux-only.

[FreeNAS Home Server Build](https://ramsdenj.github.io/server/2016/01/01/FreeNAS-Server-Build.html)

[Dr. Memory](http://drmemory.org/). I have got to start using this!

[Transit](https://github.com/cognitect/transit-format). Transit is designed to be implemented as an encoding on top of formats for which high performance processors already exist, specifically [JSON](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7159.txt) and [MessagePack](http://msgpack.org/). See [MessagePack specification](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/master/spec.md). Post on the [initial release of Transit](http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2014/7/22/transit).

[Square Defangs Difficult Decisions with this System — Here’s How](http://firstround.com/review/square-defangs-difficult-decisions-with-this-system-heres-how/)

[Speed reading promises are too good to be true, scientists find](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/01/160114163035.htm). Matches my anecdotal experience; the faster I read something, the less I really understand of it.

[RAMCloud Papers](https://ramcloud.atlassian.net/wiki/display/RAM/RAMCloud+Papers)

[wmutils](https://wmutils.io/about.html). Build your own (Linux) window manager.

[Top 30 books ranked by total number of links to Amazon in Hacker News comments](http://ramiro.org/vis/hn-most-linked-books/). An interesting reading list, and contains many good books. And some oddballs. Really, a rent book being the most mentioned?

[How You Can Leverage Technical Debt & Why You Should](https://medium.com/startup-guide-anti-patterns/how-you-can-leverage-technical-debt-why-you-should-4ec48a387751#.g4ttnl5j0)

[Why video games are essential for inventing artificial intelligence](http://togelius.blogspot.com/2016/01/why-video-games-are-essential-for.html)
