Let's review the following book. Hey, and one note: this is the draft, I need to go back
through it to have it make sense to someone who has not read the book.

12 Essential Skills for Software Architects, Dave Hendricksen, Addison-Wesley, 2012

Should you read this book? Maybe, and probably not.

This book is about three things: Relationship skills, personal skills and business skills. It's
pretty unabashedly unashamed of this focus. If that's what you're interested in, he has a second
book titled "12 More Essential Skills for Software Architects" that purports to cover technical
matters. I haven't seen that book yet. I'll end up reading and reviewing it, but mostly because
there is a shortage of books on this topic.

From the very start, his thesis is that a software architect's success begins and nearly ends
with personal skills. Or, rather, he believes that lots of people have the technical qualifications
to become architects, but few have that and the non-technical skills needed to be an architect.
I'm still nervous about this definition, because it seems circular. Someone with a different
mindset might say that all X need to be salesmen too, so Sales skills is the crucial pivot.

My view, and that of others, is that a software architect is "... software expert who makes
high-level design choices and dictates technical standards, including software coding
standards, tools, and platforms". My personal view is that effective people do need to have
relationship skills, personal skills and maybe business skills.

This book is written for a specific kind of person: a Tech Lead who has had someone else
interpreting for them and interacting with executives and customers but who now wants to
take larger responsibilities. As such, it's a roadmap for a technicall-skilled but personally-blind
person. Those people do exist. I question how common this is, but they do exist. So if you
feel like you might fit that category, or you want a refresher, this is a decent book on
people skills.

However, and this is a big one - these are the skills that all true professionals need to have.
A professional is courteous, works with others, has integrity and honesty, and so on.

Chapter 1: Gracious behavior. There's nothing in here unique to software architects.

Chapter 2: Communication. Yes, this is a key skill for architects. However, the only bits I
saw that were specific to architects were the parts about "avoid the feeding frenzy on
imperfections" and "mostly say yes (save no for special occasions). There's an entire
section how "how to speak to executives" that, while valuable, is generic advise for
professionals.

Chapter 3: Negotiation. Another key skill for architects. Again, most of this is advise for
generic professionals. I think maybe just the part titled "Do the right thing even when it's
hard" is more specifically for architects. I'd also say the "Manage to yes" section is of
particular importance to architects.
