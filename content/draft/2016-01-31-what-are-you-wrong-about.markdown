IN PROGRESS.

There are a number of things you believe that are false.

I speak of educated people. But just as in earlier ages, educated people en masse can believe in falsehoods.

Take an educated man from 1600 AD. This person very likely believes in witchcraft. He believes mice are spontaneously generated in piles of straw. He believes in magicians, such as John Dee, adviser to Queen Elizabeth. He believes it is possible to turn base metals like lead into gold. He believes that the earth is at the center of the universe and the sun and stars rotate around it. He believes in astrology.

Fortunately for you, science and education have advanced, and you very likely don't believe any of the above. But you still believe in things that are falsehoods, whether big or small.

# Religion

All religions are falsehoods, e.g. they are fabricated by people who either set out to deceive purposely or who are themselves confused. More specifically, all religions to date are falsehoods, and almost certainly any future religions will be falsehoods too.

If you believe in a religion, then what do you make of religions that were founded before yours. They must be false, right? And what about religions founded after yours. Clearly false. Can it be possible that your religion is the one true religion? No, it's not possible.

Mankind has dreamt up gods and devils for as long as there is recorded history, and there is little to doubt that the process started just then, and not before we invented writing. How is it that everything before one specific religion was made up, but this one religion is true? And what do you say to followers of other religions? You call them false, but they call you false too. Neither has proof, because there is none.

This does not mean there is no God, or gods, or some divine thing that created the heavens and the earth. But that very question, as open as it is, has nothing to do with religion.

Let's assume we could figure out which religion was first. There are two options: that religion is true, or that religion is false. If it were true, then everyone today is living in apostasy, because it's nearly certain that no religion today dates back to that first religion. In fact, many religions make it a point to establish that, before them, previous religions were falsehoods.

But if it is false, e.g. that first religion was made up, and the second, and the third, and so on - then how is it that your religion is suddenly true? You didn't examine all the religions to see which religion was most likely to be true. In fact, you are almost certainly a member of the religion of your parents, or perhaps of your spouse, or some other fostering arrangement. So if you didn't very carefully pick the right religion, how is it that you can proclaim your religion is true and not false.

You can't. It's all the more interesting because there are dozens of religions today that have millions to hundreds of millions of adherents, and none of those religions are compatible with the others.

Every religion to date has stated some things as canon that have turned out to be false. When it comes to picking between religious proclamation and scientific investigation, science wins. Evolution is real. The age of the universe is real. The universe is not tiny but is vast beyond belief.

I'm not asking you to give up a belief in a divine being, but that your specific religion is false.

We know the origin and psuedo-history of some current religions.

Mormonism proclaimed that the American continent was settled by ancient Near Easterners who came across between 5000 and 2500 years ago, that Native Americans are the descendents of ancient Israelites, that the Book of Mormon is a translation from ancient records written in Egyptian on metal plates between 2500 BC and 421 AD, that Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon from gold plates. And more. Most of this contradicts any historical or biological history. Oh, and don't forget that according to the Book of Mormon, dark skin is a sign of God's curse (only renounced by the church hierarchy at the end of 2013).

That pales to L. Ron Hubbard's Scientology, which believes that a galactic ruler named Xenu brought trillions of his people to Earth 75 million years ago to kill them and capture their essence, then the spirits were forced to watch movies to indoctrinate them in believing things like our current religions. These spirits attach themselves to humans, and are the source of our problems. Scientologist audit people to purge them of this influence. And of course this costs a lot of money. And the Xenu portion of Scientology is hidden until you reach a certain level in the church. And there's the small fact of Hubbard declaring this in the late 1940s: "Writing for a penny a word is ridiculous. If a man really wants to make a million dollars, the best way would be to start his own religion."

Older religions only look good in comparision because many more years have passed since their origins, and their stories have gathered more gloss and bigger contradictions removed. But take the stories of Mormonism and Scientology to heart; your religion is no less artificial, no less false, just older.

Some religions start out as a splinter of an existing religion, and then proclaim they are the one and only faith. Jehovah's Witnesses went from a bible reading group to a full-fledged schism that teaches that their religion is the true Christianity and all other religions are soon to be destroyed.

Is Buddhism a religion? While it is non-theistic (a rarety in religions), it has equivalent beliefs: samsara is perpetual reincarnation (and you could come back as an insect or a cow), karma is the accumulation of good and bad deads that affect you in future rebirths, there are 5 realms for rebirth that are subdivided into 31 planes of existence.

And this is before we look at the rest of the universe; our current estimate is hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars, and many of those stars with planets. There is other life out there. It won't look like us. And yet our religions are surprisingly human, our Gods think human thoughts, and our Gods never once mentioned that other beings might exist elsewhere in the universe. When we meet aliens some time in the (far?) future, they will not believe in any religion that we believe in. They might not even believe in any religion, since we do know about activities in the brain that gives rise to experiences best described as religious ecstasy. Maybe other creatures won't be wired that way.

It's not my intention to convince you that you are in error; in all likelihood, I cannot do that, just as I would have had a hard time convincing my 1600 AD fellow that witchcraft doesn't exist. But over time, your beliefs will be seen as false. It may take many hundreds of more years before this happens.

There's a chance that you, the reader of 2016 AD, does not believe in any religion. Congratulations.

# Pets

The act of keeping pets is immoral.

# Women

All current societies are organized in ways that keep women as second-class citizens at best, and more typically indentured servants or slaves.
